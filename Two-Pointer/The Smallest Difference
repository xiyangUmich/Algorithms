Given two array of integers(the first array is array A, the second array is array B), now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j], so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] (|A[i] - B[j]|) is as small as possible, return their smallest difference.

class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param A, B: Two integer arrays.
     * @return: Their smallest difference.
     */
    int smallestDifference(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
        // write your code here
        int m = A.size();
        int n = B.size();
        if(m==0 || n==0) return 0;
        
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        sort(B.begin(),B.end());
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while(i<m && j<n){
            diff = min(diff, abs(A[i]-B[j]));
            if(A[i]<B[j]) ++i;
            else ++j;
        }
        return diff;
    }
};
