You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner. 

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win. 

For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+". 

class Solution {
public:
    bool canWin(string s) {
        if(s.size()<=1) return false;
         bool isMoved=false;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size()-1;++i){
           
            if(s[i]=='+' && s[i+1]=='+'){
                isMoved = true;
                s[i]='-';
                s[i+1]='-';
                if(!canWin(s)) return true;
                s[i]='+';
                s[i+1]='+';
            }
            isMoved=false;
        }
        if(!isMoved) return false;
    }
  
};
