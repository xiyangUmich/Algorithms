Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. 

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i=0, j=height.size()-1;
        int water=0;
        int h=0;
        while(i<j){
            h=min(height[i],height[j]);
            water=max(water,h*(j-i));
            while(height[i]<=h && i<j) ++i;
            while(height[j]<=h && i<j) --j;
            
        }
        return water;
    }
};
