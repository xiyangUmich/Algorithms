A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

class Solution {
    int maxNum = 0;
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
       if(nums.size()<=1) return nums.size();
       int pos = 1, neg = 1;
       for(int i=1;i<nums.size();++i)
         if(nums[i]>nums[i-1]) pos = neg+1;
         else if(nums[i]<nums[i-1]) neg = pos+1;
       return max(pos, neg);
    }
  
};
