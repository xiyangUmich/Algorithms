Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area 


Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.


class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        int area1=(D-B)*(int)(C-A);
        int area2=(H-F)*(int)(G-E);
        int area3=(min(H, D) - max(F, B)) * (min(G, C) - max(A, E));
        if(H>B && F<D && G>A && E<C) return area1+area2-area3;
        else return area1+area2;
    }
};
